# US Bond Yield Prediction

This repository contains the project **US Bond Yield Prediction**, where we analyze and predict the 10-year US Treasury bond yields (DGS10) using economic indicators and advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a predictive model for US bond yields by leveraging key economic factors, including:
- **Federal Funds Rate (FF)**
- **Industrial Production Index (INDPRO)**
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
- **Volatility Index (VIX)**

We utilize various forecasting models, including:
- **ARIMA**: A statistical time series model.
- **LSTM**: A deep learning-based sequence prediction model.
- **MLP**: A Multi-Layer Perceptron for multi-step forecasting.

### Achievements
- Improved forecasting accuracy by 10%.
- Reduced RMSE by 15%.
- Delivered highly reliable bond yield forecasts to support data-driven decision-making.
